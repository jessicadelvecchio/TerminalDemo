<!-- ! ********** Part I ********** -->

<!-- * Answer the following questions:

- What ***git*** command creates a branch?
`git branch BRANCH_NAME_HERE` creates a branch but doesn't move your directly to that new branch
`git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME_HERE` creates a new branch and move you to that new branch

- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
A fast forward merge is when there are no conflicts and the merge takes place with no additional steps
A recursive merge is when there are merge conflicts - when two files have conflicting content. In this case, the developer will need to manually look at the differences and fix the conflict before saving, committing and then merging the code.

- What ***git*** command changes to another branch?
`git checkout BRANCH_NAME_HERE`

- What ***git*** command deletes a branch?
`git branch -d BRANCH_NAME_HERE` deletes a branch without any commits 
`git branch -D BRANCH_NAME_HERE` deletes a branch with commits. All commits will be lost in this process.

- How do merge conflicts happen? 
A recursive merge is when there are merge conflicts - when two files have conflicting content. In this case, the developer will need to manually look at the differences and fix the conflict before saving, committing and then merging the code.

<!-- ! ********** Part 2 ********** -->

<!-- Practice with fast forward and recursive merges! 
 
Make a branch and add and commit onto it and merge it back into master.

Try to create your own merge conflict by modifying the same file on two separate commits on two separate branches. -->
